Mersenne Twister - use `random.randbytes()` to XOR an input file. Provide a `main.py` that uses Python's random to "encrypt" two images in succession, providing the plaintext of the first image and the ciphertext of both the first and second images. The state should be recoverable after enough bytes in the first image, at which point it should simply be advanced to the expected position for the second image.
