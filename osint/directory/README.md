Various OSINT challenges against public University listings.

From the UNR directory:
- How many Graduate Research Assistants are there in the Computer Science and Engineering department? (select the CSE department, then use "Graduate Research Assistant" as the title; this is unlikely to change, but *could*)
- What's Mary Dugan's mailstop (0550)?

From Transparent Nevada:
- What was Brian Sandoval's total salary in 2016? ($148,755.62)
