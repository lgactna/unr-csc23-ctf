# bezier-than-most

Simple file identification challenge. `bezier` is an osu! beatmap file, or `.osz`, which is actually just a packaged ZIP that triggers a beatmap import when opened in osu!.

The sliders in the file have been arranged to form `{R0LLED}`. `{ROLLED}` should also be accepted as well, since they're close enough.
